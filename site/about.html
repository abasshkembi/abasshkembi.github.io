<h1>About</h1>
</ul><h2 id=''></h2>
I am an industrial hygienist, environmental epidemiologist, and statistician. My main interests include (i) reducing the gaps in environmental health disparities by bridging the fields of environmental health and occupational health together and (ii) using novel statistical methodology to improve industrial hygiene practice.<br><br>I am currently a PhD Candidate at the Department of Environmental Health Sciences in the University of Michigan School of Public Health under the primary mentorship of Dr. <a href='https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/neitzel-richard.html'>Richard Neitzel</a>. I was a <a href='https://cohse.umich.edu/academics/targeted-research-training-trt/'>2023-24 NIOSH Targeted Research Training Fellow</a> at the Center for Occupational Health and Safety Engineering. I graduated with my B.S in Statistics (2020) at the University of Michigan and moved onto my M.S. in Industrial Hygiene (2023) at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.<br><br>I am energized by the challenge of investigating cumulative occupational and environmental impacts by connecting industrial hygiene to environmental health because the separation of these fields is evident in research (i.e., NIOSH vs NIEHS) and in government (OSHA vs EPA). Understanding cumulative exposures in the workplace and in the community together is crucial for establishing policies that are truly protective of the public's health. Otherwise, we may be helping some people, but not helping them enough.<br><br><img src='../media/images/home_collage.png' alt='headshot'><br>
