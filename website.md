# Abas Shkembi

## About
### 
I am an occupational hygienist, environmental epidemiologist, and statistician whose research is focused on the joint impact of occupational, environmental, and social factors that shape health, health disparities, and environmental injustices. Guided by approaches in cumulative impact assessment, spatial epidemiology, and total worker health, my work seeks to disentangle how chemical, physical, and psychosocial stressors in the workplace contribute to and exacerbate ambient exposures, social determinants of health, and environmental change.

I am currently a PhD Candidate at the Department of Environmental Health Sciences in the University of Michigan School of Public Health under the primary mentorship of Dr. [Richard Neitzel](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/neitzel-richard.html). I was a [2023-24 NIOSH Targeted Research Training Fellow](https://cohse.umich.edu/academics/targeted-research-training-trt/) at the Center for Occupational Health and Safety Engineering. I graduated with my B.S in Statistics (2020) at the University of Michigan and moved onto my M.S. in Industrial Hygiene (2023) at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.
